# Getting and Cleaning Data at Coursera &mdash; Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and related documentation files for the Data Science's track course [Getting and Cleaning data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-030/), available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).


## The Project

We must create one R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Description of the Repository Contents

* `README.md` is this file.
* `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
* `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps above.
* `tidy.txt` is the output of `run_analysis.R`.
