# CodeBook

This *Code Book* describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data.

## The Source of the Data

* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


## Description of the Experiments

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (`WALKING`, `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`, `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`, `SITTING`, `STANDING`, `LAYING`) wearing a smartphone (*Samsung Galaxy S II*) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.


## The Raw Data Set

The dataset includes the following files:

- `README.txt`: Offers an overview of the data set.
- `features_info.txt`: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- `features.txt`: List of all features.
- `activity_labels.txt`: Links the class labels with their activity name.
- `train/X_train.txt`: Training set.
- `train/y_train.txt`: Training labels.
- `test/X_test.txt`: Test set.
- `test/y_test.txt`: Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

- `train/subject_train.txt`: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- `train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt`: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units g. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the `total_acc_x_train.txt` and `total_acc_z_train.txt` files for the Y and Z axis.
- `train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt`: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
- `train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt`: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.


## Details of the Transformation

There are 5 parts (plus an optional initial step):

<ol start="0">
  <li>We download and unzip the data set if that has not been done in advance.</li>
  <li>We merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
  <li>We extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
  <li>We use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
  <li>We labels appropriately the data set with descriptive variable names.</li>
  <li>From the data set in step 4, we create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>


## Structure of the Tidy Data Set

### Main Identifiers

* `Subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `Activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

### Activity Labels

* `WALKING`: Subject was walking during the test.
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: Subject was walking up a staircase during the test.
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: Subject was walking down a staircase during the test.
* `SITTING`: Subject was sitting during the test.
* `STANDING`: Subject was standing during the test.
* `LAYING`: Subject was laying down during the test.
